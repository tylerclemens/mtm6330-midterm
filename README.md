#MTM6330-Week6

**Midterm Starter**
- Fork this repo to create a copy in your GitHub account
- Rename your forked copy to be your *github-username.github.io*
- Clone it down to your computer
- Open a terminal / git-bash window in the project folder
- Run the `npm install` command to install Bootstrap and the Gulp Sass compiler
- Run the `gulp` command to start the Gulp Sass compiler in watch mode (so it will watch for changed files in the scss folder and then automatically compile to the css/min folder)
- Remember, check your terminal window from time to time. If Gulp encounters an error while compiling it will exit the watch mode, and you will have to restart it by running `gulp` again.

**Add your HTML and Sass/CSS**
- You can now edit the `index.html` (or any other html file) in the main project folder.
- In the `scss` folder, you can edit the `main.scss` file with the style directives for your design, and you can use the `_custom.scss` file to override the Bootstrap Sass variables.
- Look in the `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss` file to see the available Bootstrap Sass variables that you can use or override in your project.

**Good luck!**
